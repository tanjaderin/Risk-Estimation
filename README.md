# Dependence Modeling with Copulas for Risk Estimation

This project focuses on **dependence modeling** using copulas, a statistical method widely applied in financial and insurance sectors to model the dependence structure between multiple risk factors. 

## **Key Features**
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration and summary statistics of the dataset, including checking for missing values, outliers, and basic statistical measures.
- **Copula Fitting**: Various copula families (e.g., Gaussian, Clayton, Gumbel) were fitted to model the dependence between the risk factors.
- **Goodness-of-Fit Testing**: Evaluated the performance of the fitted copulas using statistical tests and information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC).
- **Risk Estimation**: Estimated joint risk measures such as **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** based on the fitted copula models.
- **Visualization**: Plotted dependence structures and copula density to illustrate the relationship between variables.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: R
- **Statistical Methods**: Copulas, Risk Metrics (VaR, CVaR), Goodness-of-Fit Tests
